        <h2>Blogs of IISER-land</h2>
        <p> ‚ÄúLetters have more patience than people‚Äù, or so they say. 
        Time and again, the residents of IISER have taken to writing down their feelings, 
        thoughts and opinions be it on various anecdotes or on issues plaguing the society. 
        Following is a list of blogs by our fellow mates, each of which is a mirror into their souls, 
        showcasing what they hold dear to their hearts.

     <li><a href="https://mynameissj555.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">"Shubham S. Jaiswal" by Shubham S. Jaiswal</a>: 
   Presently it's a literary blog with Hindi poetries and other poetries, stories, articles, translations and collections in 
   Hindi, English, Awadhi and Urdu</li>
     <li><a href="https://diaryofjitesh.wordpress.com" target="_blank">"Diary of Jitesh" by Jitesh Seth</a>: 
       Everything about my life that I want to share with people: thoughts, stories, art works, interesting science, book

     <li><a href="https://theuntitledjournalblog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">"The Untitled Journal" by Darshini Poola</a>: 
       To be honest, I created this blogsite out of mere impulse and curiosity. After the lockdown was announced, 
       I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands and I wanted to get back to my long-lost hobby of writing 
       (I've always been a passionate writer since junior school). Poetry is a beautiful way of organizing your 
       thoughts into the elegance of verses. Most of my posts are poems I composed trying to get clarity in my head. 
       I believe that every writer must be appreciated for his/her unique style. I occasionally draw to unwind myself and 
       I recently decided to add an art page to my blog. 
       This is where I feature some of my artistic work (my most recent venture being digital art). 
       Besides, social media has helped me connect to people with similar interests all over the globe. 
       Hopefully, readers will find the blog worth their time.</li>
