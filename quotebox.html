        <h2>The Rationale Behind This</h2>
        <p class="op"> For quite some time now, quotes have quote-unquote been all the rage here at IISER Pune.
          Ask someone from the veteran batches and they'll inform you of the #SensationalQuotesByFraandz
          movement and its derivatives that did all the rounds on social media. If anything, IISERites
          have taken the sport of quoting (and mis-quoting), and elevated it to pop-art, creating a
          cultural phenomenon that captures the angsty, young adult zeitgeist in all its flawed,
          revealing beauty.
        </p>
        <p> But as compelling as that may be, there's something beyond that as well. If brevity is the
          soul of wit, then quotes are the brevity of the soul. They often serve as mirrors in the individual
          condition, a gold mine for all the outward flourishes of the heart. And that's what we strive
          to potray here, a glimpse of what makes us tick, what makes us human, what makes us... us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which means we turn to you, in a community-driven process to supply us with material in order
          for us sift through it, and then beam it back straight and true, with hopefully a few epiphanies
          thrown in.

       <blockquote> &quot;<span class="Styled"> T</span>he path of the righteous is beset on all sides by the inequities of the
         selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good-will shephers the weak through the valley of
         darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.<br>
         And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger, those who threaten to poison and destroy my brothers. And
         you will know my name is the Lord, when I lay my vengeance upon Thee.&quot; </blockquote>

         it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of Hope, it was the winter of Despair, we had everything before us,
         we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way –<br>
         in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being
         received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.&quot; </blockquote>

         They don’t surprise you with the unforeseen. They are as familiar as the house you live in. Or the smell of your lover’s skin.
         You know how they end, yet you listen as though you don’t. In the way that although you know that one day you will die, you live as though you won’t.
         In the Great Stories you know who lives, who dies, who finds love, who doesn’t. And yet you want to know again.
         That is their mystery and magic.&quot; </blockquote>
