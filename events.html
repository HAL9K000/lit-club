        <p> <span class="Styled"> C</span>rime Scene Investigation, or CSI as it is commonly referred to happens to be the flagship event of the Lit Club,
            as well as that of <a href="http://www.karavaan.org/#l01" target="_blank">Karavaan</a>, the Annual Fest of IISERP. Ask the Karavaan honchos,
            the people on the ground, and they'll tell you the same thing: CSI is that one event that sees maximum participation
            among all the club-organised events that are held. The premise is simple enough; it's a talkative murder mystery, a la carte
            Agatha Christie, with a bunch of suspects-cum-witnesses on the scene. The official description, as per the Karavaan site
            is as follows:
          </p>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.karavaan.org/#l01">&quot;<span class="Styled"> A</span> sordid crime's gone under and a poor soul stands dispatched to the underworld under
              suspicious circumstances. Meanwhile the bumbling local force have drawn a blank in their investigation. So it's upto you to don your
              trench coat, slip on your cap and play saviour. Featuring the armchair detective in its finest iteration, interrogate a whole menagerie
              of witnesses and suspects, unearth evidence, and review and counter-review dozens of facts as you sleuth your way towards unravelling
              the web of deceit that encompasses the truth. The game's afoot!&quot;
            </blockquote>
        <p>  <span class="Styled"> W</span>hat that description doesn't tell you, is how much fun it is to organise and build CSI. It's one-month of creative madness
             and organised chaos. Narrative and character arcs arise from the background static and are taken down ruthlessly, many times
             over until the entire murderous plot stands honed to bloody perfection. Midnight reveries, late-night stakeouts, crazy-last-minute brainstorms,
             surprise treats, everything's up for the reckoning and all are fair game.
           </p>

        <p> <span class="Styled"> T</span>he Treasure Hunt is our other flagship event, held in the Spring Semester each year. A relatively young event, it has
            nonetheless gained a lot of traction in its year of inception, with praise coming in from several quarters that &quot;this was
            the best treasure hunt held till date,period&quot;. Keeping that in mind, we intend to carry on that winning
            streak, and shape it up for further evolution. As with CSI, this requires concerted efforts of all involved to pull off, and like
            CSI, the sheer unadulterated joy of having participants run into the ground is more than worth it.

       <h2> Poetry Nights </h2>
        <img src="imago/poetrynight.jpg" alt="Poetry Night" title="Starry, starry night..."/>
        <div>
        <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>he poetry reading sessions at IISER Pune are a true celebration of the diversity of poetic talent on campus. These sessions,
          held in the fashion of Dead Poets Society, usually start at nine in the night and go on till four in the morning. There is
          freedom to present original work or work you admire. Poets sit in a circle, often in the shade of a tree or out in the open.
          The Lit-Club strives to generate the cult-like ambience that is the signature of contemplative poetry in general.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>hroughout the night, ideas flow as each person presents one lucid piece after another. Quite like the movements of a sonata,
          the poems add to each others content, enforcing or invalidating feelings previously voiced. There is stimulating conversation
          about style, about content and about history.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Styled"> W</span>hether you enjoy Tagore in his native Bengali or Urdu shayari, you will find likeminded company. Whether you appreciate
          Tennyson or Button Poetry, you will be welcomed. Whether you enjoy discussing literary style or simply have fun talking
          about the nature of Life, the Universe and Everything, the Lit-Club poetry reading sessions are for you.

      <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>he Lit Club aims to bring the rich tradition of debating to IISER Pune with the Hemingway Memorial Debate. Presenting IISERP's
        first "debate", this will pit together two teams consisting of a mixture of faculty and students in order to meaningfully
        address some pertinent issue that's central to the scientific community &amp; academia.

          as well as a few talks co-hosted with the HSS Department of IISER Pune. A prime example of the latter was a performance by the
          noted author, William Dalrymple and Vidya Shah, held in the CV Raman Auditorium, which we had the fortune of hosting in
          conjugation with SPICMACAY and the HSS Dept.

        <p><span class="Styled"> O</span>ther than this, we also hold two other events in addition to CSI during Karavaan, namely <a href="http://www.karavaan.org/#l01" target="_blank">JAM</a> and
          <a href="http://www.karavaan.org/#l02" target="_blank"><span class="ital">Whirlwind Poetry</span></a>, IISERP's very own Poetry Slam.
