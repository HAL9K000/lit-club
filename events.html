        <p> <span class="Styled"> C</span>rime Scene Investigation, or CSI as it is commonly referred to happens to be the flagship event of the Lit Club,
            as well as that of <a href="http://www.karavaan.org/#l01" target="_blank">Karavaan</a>, the Annual Fest of IISERP. Ask the Karavaan honchos,
            the people on the ground, and they'll tell you the same thing: CSI is that one event that sees maximum participation
            among all the club-organised events that are held. The premise is simple enough; it's a talkative murder mystery, a la carte
            Agatha Christie, with a bunch of suspects-cum-witnesses on the scene. The official description, as per the Karavaan site
            is as follows:
          </p>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.karavaan.org/#l01">&quot;<span class="Styled"> A</span> sordid crime's gone under and a poor soul stands dispatched to the underworld under
              suspicious circumstances. Meanwhile the bumbling local force have drawn a blank in their investigation. So it's upto you to don your
              trench coat, slip on your cap and play saviour. Featuring the armchair detective in its finest iteration, interrogate a whole menagerie
              of witnesses and suspects, unearth evidence, and review and counter-review dozens of facts as you sleuth your way towards unravelling
              the web of deceit that encompasses the truth. The game's afoot!&quot;
            </blockquote>
        <p>  <span class="Styled"> W</span>hat that description doesn't tell you, is how much fun it is to organise and build CSI. It's one-month of creative madness
             and organised chaos. Narrative and character arcs arise from the background static and are taken down ruthlessly, many times
             over until the entire murderous plot stands honed to bloody perfection. Midnight reveries, late-night stakeouts, crazy-last-minute brainstorms,
             surprise treats, everything's up for the reckoning and all are fair game.
           </p>

        <p> <span class="Styled"> T</span>he Treasure Hunt is our other flagship event, held in the Spring Semester each year. A relatively young event, it has
            nonetheless gained a lot of traction in its year of inception, with praise coming in from several quarters that &quot;this was
            the best treasure hunt held till date,period&quot;. Keeping that in mind, we intend to carry on that winning
            streak, and shape it up for further evolution. As with CSI, this requires concerted efforts of all involved to pull off, and like
            CSI, the sheer unadulterated joy of having participants run into the ground is more than worth it.

       <h2> Poetry Nights </h2>

        <div>
        <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>he poetry reading sessions at IISER Pune are a true celebration of the diversity of poetic talent on campus. These sessions,
          held in the fashion of Dead Poets Society, usually start at nine in the night and go on till four in the morning. There is
          freedom to present original work or work you admire. Poets sit in a circle, often in the shade of a tree or out in the open.
          The Lit-Club strives to generate the cult-like ambience that is the signature of contemplative poetry in general.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>hroughout the night, ideas flow as each person presents one lucid piece after another. Quite like the movements of a sonata,
          the poems add to each others content, enforcing or invalidating feelings previously voiced. There is stimulating conversation
          about style, about content and about history.
        </p>
        <p><span class="Styled"> W</span>hether you enjoy Tagore in his native Bengali or Urdu shayari, you will find likeminded company. Whether you appreciate
          Tennyson or Button Poetry, you will be welcomed. Whether you enjoy discussing literary style or simply have fun talking
          about the nature of Life, the Universe and Everything, the Lit-Club poetry reading sessions are for you.

      <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>he Hemingway Memorial Debate was conceptualised as a result of a desire for introducing debate culture to IISER
        Pune. As an institute with diverse talent, IISER-P has a galaxy of eloquent speakers which include both professors and students. The Lit Club,
        with this annual debate, aims to harness this talent for stirring up some conversation on the important issues of our times - both scientific and social.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Styled"> E</span>rnest Hemingway was an American author and Nobel Prize winner in Literature whose work is widely considered to be the
        epitome of brevity and clarity: the primary qualities required of a good argument.
        The Lit Club takes significant inspiration from his 'straightforward prose, his spare dialogue, and his predilection for understatement'.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Styled"> I</span>ntroducing to IISER Pune, the motion:</p>
      <p class="ital">This house believes that The Journal Of Controversial Ideas is a beneficial addition to current scientific discourse and wider society.
      </p>
      <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>he motion of the Second Hemingway Memorial Debate as stated above is a result of the ongoing academic discussion on the pros and cons of the aptly titled
        Journal Of Controversial Ideas. Wikipedia, an objective source states that:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journal_of_Controversial_Ideas">&quot;<span class="Styled"> T</span>he Journal of Controversial Ideas is a projected cross-disciplinary, peer-reviewed journal that
        aims to allow academics to publish using pseudonyms if they request it. Founded in 2018 by Jeff McMahan, Francesca Minerva and Peter Singer, the first issue is expected in 2019. According
        to McMahan, an Oxford philosopher, the journal is needed because of the fear that exists among academics about publishing articles that support certain contentious positions.
        Minerva, a bioethicist, came up with the idea after experiencing death threats and difficulty finding employment because of an article she wrote on the ethics of newborn infanticide.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p><span class="Styled"> T</span>his topic directly touches and puts a new spin on the evergreen and timeless debate on the limits of free speech, or indeed whether there should be
        any limits imposed in the first place. If anything, adding considerations of the ideal of unimpeded distribution of scientific knowledge to the fray, brings heightened urgency to the
        discourse, requiring inputs from nuanced thinkers and debaters who happen to be in the know.</p>
      <p><span class="Styled"> W</span>hich is why the Lit Club at IISER Pune brings to you a debate on one of the most controversial issues in science publishing with a wide array of scientists and science students
        from across scientific disciplines and academic backgrounds.
      </p>

          conjugation with SPICMACAY and the HSS Dept.
